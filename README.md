# module5_pymaceuticals

Attached please find the documents for the Module 5 Challenge within the Pymaceuticals folder:
  - The pymaceuticals_SW.ipynb file that features all of the calculations and the final analyses.
  - A 'data' folder with two csv files ('Mouse_metadata' and 'Study_results') that were read as part of the pymaceuticals_SW.ipynb file


    Thank you!
