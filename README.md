# module5_pymaceuticals

Attached please find the documents for the Module 5 Challenge within the Pymaceuticals folder:
  - The pymaceuticals_SW.ipynb file that features all of the calculations and the final analyses.
  - A 'data' folder with two csv files ('Mouse_metadata' and 'Study_results') that were read as part of the pymaceuticals_SW.ipynb file

Note:
  -  As part of the Quartiles section, I was able to arrive at the correct answer for the boxplot and the outliers by utilizing a different method than is outlined on the Module 5 instructions and grading scale. I was not sure if I would be deducted points for not utilizing the listed steps including the groupby, resetting the index, the empty list and creating a for loop. If that would the case even though the final answer is correct, I can go back and work on this section to resubmit.

    Thank you!
